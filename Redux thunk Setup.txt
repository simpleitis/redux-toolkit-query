Redux thunk is part of redux tool kit

Creat a folder called 'thunks' inside the 'store' folder and create file 'fetchUsers.js' and write out the thunk

Import the thunk into the slice and listen for action objects dispatched by thunk. The action objects are fetchUsers.pending, fetchUsers.fulfilled and fetchUsers.rejected

export thunk from 'index.js' inside the store folder

use the 'use-thunk' inside different files to make use of thunks such as fetchUsers, addUser and removeUser
